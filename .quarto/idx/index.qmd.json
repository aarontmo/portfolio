{"title":"About Me","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"About Me"},"headingText":"My Journey","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n![](data\\images\\portfolio_profile_pic.jpg){width=20%}\n\nWelcome to my corner of the web! I'm Aaron Morris, a passionate Data Scientist with a strong background in Applied Biostatistics Data Science. My journey through academia and professional experiences has molded me into a data enthusiast, adept at turning complex data into meaningful insights.\n\n\nI hold a Master’s degree in Applied Biostatistics from Boston University and a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry with a minor in Statistics from Brigham Young University - Idaho. These academic experiences laid the groundwork for my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.\n\n# My Expertise\nOver the years, I've honed my skills in various aspects of data science:\n\n**Predictive Data Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis:** I love diving deep into data to uncover patterns and build models that predict future trends (see [Predicting Breast Cancer](breast_cancer_prediction.qmd)).\n\n**Data Visualization:** Proficient in ggplot2, matplotlib, plotly, and seaborn, I create visuals that tell compelling stories from data.\n\n**Programming:** I'm well-versed in Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Scikit-Image, Statsmodels, Selenium) and R, making me versatile in handling diverse data science projects.\n\n**SQL & Jupyter Notebook:** These tools are integral to my workflow, helping me manage and analyze data efficiently.\n\n**Image Processing & Classical Image Segmentation:** I have experience in processing and analyzing complex image data, particularly in the biomedical field.\n\n**Git Source Control:** Collaboration and version control are crucial in my projects, ensuring smooth teamwork and project management.\n\n# Professional Adventures\n\n**Elephas Biosciences**\n\nAt Elephas Biosciences, I worked as a Data Scientist, providing analytical support for various R&D projects. My role involved quality control report automation, differential analysis, fold change analysis, and microscopy image processing. One of my proudest achievements was reducing assay time by 67% through fold change analysis on cytokine concentration levels.\n\n**Boston University School of Public Health**\n\nAs a Graduate Research Assistant, I delved into MRI image processing to predict brain tumor survivability based on gene mutations. I developed coefficient images using Python and Numpy, extracted quantitative features with Pyradiomics, and used machine learning models to predict gene mutations.\n\nIn my role as a Research Data Analyst, I supported chronic kidney disease research in Nicaragua. I computed summary statistics, built visualizations, and developed regression models to investigate relationships between health indicators and demographic traits.\n\n**BYU-Idaho Institutional Data and Analysis Services**\n\nHere, I transformed messy data into clean, actionable insights using R programming and the tidyverse. I created and maintained dashboards in Power BI, and automated data gathering processes, enhancing the efficiency of data management.\n\n# Beyond Data\n\nWhen I'm not immersed in data, you'll likely find me enjoying the great outdoors. I love hiking, camping, and rock climbing. I also have a passion for playing pickleball, a sport that keeps me active and competitive.\n\n# Let's Connect\n\nI believe in the power of collaboration and am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out to me on LinkedIn. Let's turn data into actionable insights together!\n\nContact Me:\n\nEmail: aaronmorris9696@gmail.com\n\nLinkedIn: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-morris-201517/)\n\nThank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you!\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n![](data\\images\\portfolio_profile_pic.jpg){width=20%}\n\nWelcome to my corner of the web!
